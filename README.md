# Connect 4
This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://theodinproject.com) Ruby curriculum.

As always, if you've never heard of the board game 'Connect four', refer to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

In short... *(from Wikipedia, slightly adjusted)*
> The first player starts Connect Four by dropping one of their discs into a column of an empty game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until one of the players, achieves four discs in a row, and wins the game. If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.

## Some rules
- Two players can't have same names
- When asked for player's circle, enter a color from the screen (e.g. ``` red ```)
- When asked for the circle position, enter a number between *1 and 7* (inclusive)
- You can enter ``` quit ``` into the terminal instead of the position, if you want to exit the current game

## Side notes
This was my first project using Rspec, so the tests in the ``` spec ``` folder are nowhere near best, and surely don't follow the majority of best practices.
